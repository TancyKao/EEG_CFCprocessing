# Post-hoc Analysis

## Individual Level ('run_acc.py' script, based on functions from 'all_fxns.py')
### The script's outputs include the following:
1. Count/ density of the coupled spindles
2. Cleaned csv files for slow-waves/spindles events (outliers are replacing)
3. Summary of the outliers

**For each sleep stage, will be created a seperated folder with its relevant csv files. 
More details about the outpus will be explained in elaboration below.  

.. _1_:Preperation
.. _2_:Running the code
.. _3_:Outputs

1. Preperation:
**NOTICE : this script is based on the outputs of the follwing codes: general_setup, Whales_setup_swa, Whales_setup_spindle.

Beofre running the 'run_acc.py' script, you will need to:
1.1. Create a new sub-folder in the 'Main folder', i.e 'raw_data'.
1.2. Inside the 'raw_data' folder, create the following folders:
1) **errors**- keep empty.
2) **hypno**- insert to this folder all the 4 txt files of the subjects. 
3) **source**- create a folder for each subject. Within each subject folder create 'slowwave' and 'spindle' folders with the relevant data.

An example for the data organization:
.. image:: img/org_raw.png
    :width: 300px
    :align: center
    :height: 200px
    :alt: alternate text

1.3. Fill the follwing parameters:
ppt_id - participant it
root_dir - the path for the raw_data folder (for example:'S:\\Sleep\\SleepSoftware\\Coupling_Python_PC2\\CFC_080920\\raw_data\\')
channels - relevant electrodes (for example: ['E1'])
stage - can be NREM/ N2/ SWS

2. Running the code, meaning of the code's parts: 
2.1. Generating the 'results' folder and sub-folders:
.. literalinclude:: pycode/run_aac-single_chan.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: tag::folders[]
   :end-before: end::folders[]

This part is generating in the 'raw_data' folder a new sub-folder named 'results', with the following folders inside:
.. image:: img/results_list.png
    :width: 300px
    :align: center
    :height: 200px
    :alt: alternate text

Notice that this function is generating only empty folders, which will served us later on with the following functions.

2.2. Merging files and removing outliers:
Each event type has its own function for that ('slowwave', 'fast_spindles' and 'slow_spindles').
Example of the 'slowwave' function, which responsible for merging relevant files (that were generated by the previous script 'Whales_setup_swa'), idintifying outlieres and replacing these values.
.. literalinclude:: pycode/run_aac-single_chan.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: tag::slowwave[]
   :end-before: end::slowwave[]


2.3. Reciving the coupling percentage:
The following part in the code include the founction: 'get_aac_fast_spindles', 'get_aac_slow_spindles'.

Example for the 'get_aac_fast_spindles' code:

2.4. calling the relevant functions:
.. literalinclude:: pycode/run_aac-single_chan.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :start-after: tag::functions[]
   :end-before: end::functions[]
