1. Count/ density of the coupled spindles
2. Cleaned csv files for slow-waves/spindles events (outliers are replacing)

**NOTICE : this script is based on the outputs of the follwing codes: general_setup, Whales_setup_swa, Whales_setup_spindle.

Beofre running the 'run_acc.py' script, you will need to:
1.1. Create a new sub-folder in the 'Main folder', i.e 'raw_data'.
1. 2. Inside the 'raw_data' folder, create the following folders:
1) **errors**- keep empty.
2) **hypno**- insert to this folder all the 4 txt files of the subjects. 
3) **source**- create a folder for each subject. Within each subject folder create 'slowwave' and 'spindle' folders with the relevant data.

An example for the data organization:
